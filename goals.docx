1) Difficulty settings:
Difficulty (1 - 3)
Light speed can be changed via difficulty setting ie updateShadowRenderer(light/difficulty) therefore the more difficult the faster the light or something
Amount of asteroids change by difficulty (Set max asteroids to 5 * difficulty)
Amount of pluses = 2 * difficulty
Rotation speed = 400 / difficulty


2) ASteroid spawn checker:
class Phaser.Math {

    Checks if two values are within the given tolerance of each other.

        arg number a

            The first number to check

        arg number b

            The second number to check

        arg number tolerance

            The tolerance. Anything equal to or less than this is considered within the range.

        returns True if a is <= tolerance of b.

    boolean within(a, b, tolerance)








SCORE AND TEXT :
renderShadow : boolean

    Should the text be rendered with a slight shadow? Makes it easier to read on different types of background.
